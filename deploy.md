Smoll Infrastructure: Deployment & Routing Overview
Big Picture
Browser → Cloudflare DNS → DigitalOcean Droplet → Nginx → Docker Container
There are two environments, each on its own DigitalOcean droplet:

Environment	Droplet Name	Branch
Production	server-prod	master
Staging	server-dev	staging
Cloudflare handles DNS and sits in front of both.

The Repos and What They Are
Repo	What it is	Port	URL pattern
sf-server-v2	NestJS backend API + Nginx + Redis	3000 (API), 81 (WebSocket)	api.smoll.me / staging-api.smoll.me
sf-admin	Vue/Vite admin portal	5175	admin.smoll.me / staging-admin.smoll.me
sf-partner	Vue/Vite partner portal	5174	partner.smoll.me / staging-partner.smoll.me
sf-vetsuite	Vue/Vite expert/vet portal	5173	expert.smoll.me / staging-expert.smoll.me
How GitHub Actions Deploys to DigitalOcean
Every repo has .github/workflows/pipeline.yml. It triggers on push to master (production) or staging branch.

The deploy steps for each repo:

Connect via SSH using secrets stored in GitHub repo settings: HOST, USERNAME, SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
Copy files to the droplet — admin/partner use scp, server/vetsuite use rsync
Write a .env file on the server with all the environment variables (API keys, DB URL, etc.)
Rebuild the Docker container: docker-compose down → build → up -d
For sf-server-v2 only: also runs DB migrations (yarn migration:run) and seeds after container starts
The target droplet is determined by which branch was pushed to. All repos use the same conditional in pipeline.yml:

HOST: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' && secrets.HOST || secrets.STAGING_HOST }}
Branch	GitHub Secret used	Droplet
master	HOST	server-prod
staging	STAGING_HOST	server-dev
Both secrets are set per repo in GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

Docker Network: How Everything Connects
sf-server-v2 owns the Docker Compose stack that creates the shared network (sf-server_default). It runs:

nginx container (the reverse proxy)
app container (the NestJS API)
redis container
The three frontend repos (sf-admin, sf-partner, sf-vetsuite) each have their own docker-compose.yml that spins up a single container and joins the existing sf-server_default network:

networks:
  default:
    name: sf-server_default
    external: true
sf-server-v2 must be deployed first before the frontends can come up, since it creates the shared network.

How Nginx Routes Requests
Nginx lives inside the sf-server-v2 stack (mounted from nginx.conf). It listens on port 80 and routes by hostname (server_name):

Incoming hostname          →  Upstream (Docker service:port)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
expert.smoll.me            →  localhost:5173  (sf-vetsuite container)
staging-expert.smoll.me    →  localhost:5173

partner.smoll.me           →  localhost:5174  (sf-partner container)
staging-partner.smoll.me   →  localhost:5174

admin.smoll.me             →  localhost:5175  (sf-admin container)
staging-admin.smoll.me     →  localhost:5175

api.smoll.me               →  app:3000        (backend API)
staging-api.smoll.me       →  app:3000

/socket (on any host)      →  app:81          (WebSocket)
The nginx container uses host.docker.internal to reach the frontend containers (which are on the host's Docker network, not inside the nginx container itself). For the API (app), it uses the Docker service name directly since they're in the same compose stack.

Nginx also handles:

client_max_body_size 100M — for large file uploads
WebSocket upgrade headers — for socket.io
Cloudflare's Role
Cloudflare sits in front as the DNS provider. Each subdomain (api.smoll.me, admin.smoll.me, etc.) has an A record pointing to the DigitalOcean droplet's IP. With the proxy (orange cloud) enabled:

SSL termination happens at Cloudflare (HTTPS → HTTP to the droplet)
Nginx on the droplet receives plain HTTP on port 80
DDoS protection and CDN caching come for free
Adding a new subdomain: You need to (1) add an A record in Cloudflare DNS pointing to the droplet IP, (2) add a server_name block in sf-server-v2/nginx.conf, and (3) redeploy sf-server-v2.

Deployment Order (Critical)
When setting up a fresh droplet from scratch:

sf-server-v2 first — creates the Docker network, starts nginx, redis, and the API
Then any order: sf-vetsuite, sf-partner, sf-admin — they join the existing network
Where Secrets Live
GitHub Actions secrets per repo (set in GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)
On the server, .env files are written to ~/app/<service>/ during each deploy
Never committed to git
